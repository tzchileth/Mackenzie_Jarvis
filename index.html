            <p>Hi, I am <span class="name"></span>. 
                I am from Detroit, Michigan where the weather is always changing and 
                the people are always complaining. I live in two seperate households. In one household I 
                stay with my mom and and my 12 year old sister. In the other household I stay with my dad,
                stepmom, 8 year old brother and 17 year old sister. Both of my households get along really
                well and that is why I love our little dynamic.
